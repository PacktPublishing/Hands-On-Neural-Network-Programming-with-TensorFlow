# Hands-On-Neural-Network-Programming-with-TensorFlow
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Neural Network Programming with TensorFlow [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-neural-network-programming-tensorflow-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Ever wondered how you can solve everyday data problems quickly and easily like automating text processing, classifying images, and predicting results? Neural networks and Tensorflow, one of the most powerful technologies, will come to your rescue. These are important technologies for data scientists to know because they are often more powerful than traditional machine learning techniques. 
In this course, you'll use neural nets to solve business and other real-world problems and make predictions quickly and easily. You'll program a machine to identify a human face, predict stock market prices, and process text as part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). You'll also gain experience using generative models and autoencoders to create artwork and enhance images. 
By the end of this course, you will be able to tackle a range of challenges beyond this course and will have a fair understanding of how you can use the power of TensorFlow to train neural networks of varying complexities, without any hassle.
